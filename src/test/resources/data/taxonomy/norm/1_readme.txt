A very simple example showing:
a) The first 2 rows that will merge in higher taxa to a single classification 
  (note the homonym on row 4 has authorship which does not prevent this merge)
b) The 3rd row will infer higher taxonomy from the first 2
c) A homonym scenario (species of "s", with differing author and higher taxa)
